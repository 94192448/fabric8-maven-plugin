For Kubernetes builds the fabric8-maven-plugin uses the Docker remote API so the URL of your Docker Daemon must be specified. The URL can be specified by the dockerHost or machine configuration, or by the `DOCKER_HOST` environment variable. If not given

The Docker remote API supports communication via SSL and
authentication with certificates.  The path to the certificates can
be specified by the certPath or machine configuration, or by the
`DOCKER_CERT_PATH` environment variable.
