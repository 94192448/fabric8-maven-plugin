WARNING: This is a placeholder. Will be filled soon.

Enriching is the complementary concept to <<generators, Generators>>. Whereas Generators are used to create and customize Docker images, Enrichers are use to create and customize Kubernetes and OpenShift resource objects.

There are a lot similarities to Generatos:

* Each Enricher has a unique name.
* Enrichers are looked up automatically from dependencies provied and there is a set of default enrichers delivered with this plugin.
* Enrichers are configured the same ways as generators

The <<generator-example,Generator example>> is a good bluebprint, simply replace `<generator>` with `<enricher>`. The configuration is structural identical:

.Enricher configuration
[cols="1,6"]
|===
| Element | Description

| `<includes>`
| Contains one ore more `<include>` elements with enricher names which should be included. If given, only this list of enrichers are included in this order.

| `<excludes>`
| Holds one or more `<exclude>` elements with enricher names to exclude. This means all the detected enrichers are used except the ones mentioned in this section.

| `<config>`
| Configuration for all enrichers. Each enricher supports a specific set of configuration values as described in its documentation. The subelements of this section are enricher names. E.g. for enricher `f8-service`, the sub-element is called `<f8-service>`. This element then holds the specific enricher configuration like `<name>` for the service name.

This plugin comes with a set of default enrichers. In addition custom enrichers can be easily added by providing implementation of the <<enricher-api, Enricher API>> and adding these as a dependency to the build.

== Fabric8 Enrichers

fabric8-maven-plugin comes with a set of enrichers which are enabled by default.
