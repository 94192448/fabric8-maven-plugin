[[fabric8:deploy]]
== *fabric8:deploy*

This goal will take all the kubernetes resources generated by the <<fabric8:resource>> goal and apply them into the current kubernetes cluster.

[source,sh,subs="attributes"]
----
mvn install fabric8:deploy
----

Its usually simpler to just use the <<fabric8:run>> goal which performs a build and runs `fabric8:deploy`:

[source,sh,subs="attributes"]
----
mvn fabric8:run
----

The resources applied are from `target/classes/META-INF/fabric8/kubernetes/*.yml` if using a Kubernetes cluster or `target/classes/META-INF/fabric8/openshift/*.yml` if you are using an OpenShift cluster

=== Undeploy

You can delete the kubernetes resources deployed into kubernetes via `fabric8:deploy` via the <<fabric8:undeploy>> goal

[source,sh,subs="attributes"]
----
mvn fabric8:undeploy
