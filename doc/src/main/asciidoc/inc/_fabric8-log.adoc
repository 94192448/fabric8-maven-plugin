== *fabric8:log*

This goal tails the log of the app that you deployed via the <<fabric8:deploy>> goal

[source, sh]
----
mvn fabric8:log
----

You can then terminate the output by hitting `Ctrl+C`

If you wish to get the log of the app and then terminate immediately then try:

[source, sh]
----
mvn fabric8:log -Dfabric8.log.follow=false
----

This lets you pipe the output into grep or some other tool

[source, sh]
----
mvn fabric8:log -Dfabric8.log.follow=false | grep Exception
