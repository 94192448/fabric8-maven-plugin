[[fabric8:run]]
== *fabric8:run*

This goal builds your application (generating the docker image and kubernetes manifest), deploys it on the current kubernetes cluster then tails the logs of the first pod that starts until you hit `Ctrl+C` then the application is undeployed.

[source,sh,subs="attributes"]
----
mvn fabric8:run
----

So this goal feels very much like the `run` goal in other maven plugins like spring-boot, tomcat, jetty, wildfly etc.

You can think of this goal as being similar to performing:

[source,sh,subs="attributes"]
----
mvn fabric8:deploy
mvn fabric8:logs
...
^C
mvn fabric8:undeploy
----

**Note** that you must have the <<fabric8:resource>> and <<fabric8:build>> goals bound to your executions in your pom.xml. e.g. like this:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
----
<plugin>
  <groupId>io.fabric8</groupId>
  <artifactId>fabric8-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>{version}</version>

  <!-- Connect fabric8:resource, fabric8:build and fabric8:helm to lifecycle phases -->
  <executions>
    <execution>
       <id>fabric8</id>
       <goals>
         <goal>resource</goal>
         <goal>build</goal>
         <goal>helm</goal>
       </goals>
    </execution>
  </executions>
</plugin>
