[[fabric8:run]]
== *fabric8:run*

This is the main goal for building your docker image, generating the kubernetes resources and deploying them into the cluster.

[source,sh,subs="attributes"]
----
mvn fabric8:run
----

This goal is really just short hand for:

[source,sh,subs="attributes"]
----
mvn install fabric8:deploy
----

Effectively this builds your project then invokes these goals:

* <<fabric8:resource>>
* <<fabric8:build>>
* <<fabric8:deploy>>


=== Undeploy

You can delete the kubernetes resources deployed into kubernetes via `fabric8:run` via the <<fabric8:delete>> goal

[source,sh,subs="attributes"]
----
mvn fabric8:delete
----
