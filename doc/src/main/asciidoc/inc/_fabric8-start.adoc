[[fabric8:start]]
== *fabric8:start*

This goal starts the app that you deployed via the <<fabric8:deploy>> goal and then subsequently stopped via <<fabric8:stop>>.

[source, sh]
----
mvn fabric8:start
----

This goal iterates through all scaleable resources generated by the <<fabric8:resource>> goal and scales them to a _replica count_ of`1` so that by the time this goal completes there should be a single running pod of this app.
