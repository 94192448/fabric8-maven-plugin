The usual way to define Docker images is with the plugin configuration as explained in <<fabric8:build>>. This can either be done completly within the pom.xml or by refering to an external Dockerfile. Since fabric8-maven-plugin includes our https://github.com/fabric8io/docker-maven-plugin[docker-maven-plugin] the way how images are built is identical.

However, this plugin provides an additional route for defining image configurations. This is done by so called _Generators_. A generator is a Java component providing an auto-detection mechanism for certain build type like a Spring Boot build or a plain Java build. As soon as a generator detects that it is applicable it will be called with the list of images configured in the pom.xml. Typically a generator only creates dynamically an image configuration if this list is empty. But a generator is free to also add new images to an existing list or even change the current image list.

You can easily create your own generator as explained in <<generators-api, Generator API>>. This section however will focus on existing generators and how you can configure them.

By default, this plugin includes already a set of generators,  which are explained in detail below. These generators are enabled by default, but you can easil disable them or only select a certain set of generators. Each generator has a _name_, which is unique for a generator.

The generator configuration is embedded in a `<generator>` configuration section:

.Example for a generator configuration
[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
----
<plugin>
  ....
  <configuration>
    ....
    <generator> <!--1-->
      <includes> <!--2-->
        <include>spring-boot</include>
      </includes>
      <config> <!--3-->
        <spring-boot> <!--4-->
          <alias>ping</alias>
        </spring-boot>
      </config>
    </generator>
  </configuration>
</plugin>
----
<1> Start of generators' configuration.
<2> Generators can be included and excluded. Includes have precedence, and the generators are called in the given order.
<3> Configuration for individual generators.
<4> The config is a map of supported config values. Each section is embedded in a tag named after the generator.

Generators can be configured with a `<generator>` section. The following sub-elements are supported.

.Generator configuration
[cols="1,6"]
|===
| Element | Description

| `<includes>`
| Contains one ore more `<include>` elements with generator names which should be include. If given, only this list of generators are included in this order.

| `<excludes>`
| Holds one or more `<exclude>` elemens with generator names to exclude. This mean all the detected generators are used except the ones mentioned in this section.

| `<config>`
| Configuration for all generators. Each generator support a specific set of configuration values as described in the documentation. The subelements of this section are tags named as the generator to configure. E.g. for generator `spring-boot`, the sub-element is called `<spring-boot>`. This element then holds the specific generator configuration like `<name>` for specifying the final image name. See above for an example

fabric8-maven-plugin comes with a set of default generators which are described in the next secion <<generators-stock, Stock Generators>>. These are enabled by default. In addition, custom generators can be easily added by simply declaring a compile scoped dependency in the `pom.xml`. How this can be done and how such a generator can be implemented is described in <<generators-api, Generator API>>.
